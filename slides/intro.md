<!--
In this presentation we will talk about:

1. Why Zig might be interesting for a JS developer. And why I think it's better than native languages in the same "league": C, C++, Rust.
2. Features that Zig decides to leave out of the language, and why.
3. Building a project: JS vs Zig.
4. Error handling: JS vs Zig.
5. How to develop hybrid JS/Zig projects (in browser, Node.js and other runtimes).
6. How to use Zig libraries, and the Zig package manager.
7. If there is enough time, we will see a bit of Zig syntax.
