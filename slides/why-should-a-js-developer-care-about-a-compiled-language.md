    <!-- <p>There are several reasons why a Node.js developer, or any developer who primarily works in an interpreted language, might want to learn about or use a compiled language:</p> -->
    <ol slot="quote">
      <li><b>Performance:</b> Compiled languages like C++, Rust, or Go often offer better performance than interpreted languages. This can be important for <span class="color:accent">CPU-intensive tasks, algorithms, or systems programming</span>.</li>
      <li><b>Understanding of low-level details:</b> Learning a compiled language can give you a <span class="color:accent">better understanding of what's happening under the hood</span> in your system. This can help you write more efficient code, even in higher-level languages like JavaScript.</li>
      <li><b>Interoperability:</b> Node.js supports native addons, which are <span class="color:accent">dynamically-linked shared objects</span> written in C++. These addons can be used to perform tasks that are either more efficiently done in C++, or simply not possible in JavaScript.</li>
      <li><b>Type Safety:</b> Many compiled languages are statically typed, meaning type checking is done at compile time. This can help catch errors earlier in the development process. While JavaScript is dynamically typed, <span class="color:accent">understanding static typing systems</span> can still be beneficial, especially with the rise of TypeScript in the JavaScript ecosystem.</li>
      <li><b>Career Flexibility:</b> Having experience in both interpreted and compiled languages can make you a more versatile developer and open up <span class="color:accent">more job opportunities</span>.</li>
      <li><b>Different Paradigms:</b> Many compiled languages use <span class="color:accent">different programming paradigms</span> (like functional or procedural programming) than JavaScript. Learning these can broaden your problem-solving skills and help you write better code in any language.</li>
      <li><b>WebAssembly:</b> This is a binary instruction format that allows code written in languages like C, C++, and Rust to run in the browser alongside JavaScript. As a Node.js developer, <span class="color:accent">learning about WebAssembly</span> can be beneficial as it becomes more prevalent in web development.</li>
    </ol>
    <!-- <p>Remember that while there are benefits to learning a compiled language, it's not a requirement for being a successful Node.js developer. It's just another tool you can add to your toolbox.</p> -->
